Please, this is a step forward in the assembly of a laboratory with the installation of a KMS server in a virtual machine **Ubuntu 16.07** or also in a **router (Lan-Dropbox)** with operating system **OPEN-WRT** that performs activations of windows licenses with the data and steps provided by Microsoft through its website.
